Queue System
============================

For situations where your site is under high load, and you can't scale quickly enough to cope with the increased traffic, we have created a queue system which can be used to limit the amount of users hitting your site at any one time.

.. warning::
   Please note that this system is currently in beta, and you may experience teething problems while getting it properly configured.
